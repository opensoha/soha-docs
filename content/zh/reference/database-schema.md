# Database Schema

## PostgreSQL Tables

### users

Core identity profile.

Suggested JSONB fields:

- `tags`
- `preferences`

### teams

Organization-unit compatibility table with optional JSONB metadata. New deployments should treat this surface as company/department organization data while legacy `team` subject and binding names remain compatibility aliases.

Suggested relational fields:

- `parent_id`
- `org_path`
- `source`
- `external_id`

### projects

Project scope bound to teams and environments.

### roles

System and custom roles with JSONB capability descriptors.

### user_role_bindings

User-to-role bindings. Local administrator assignments keep `source = local`; login-time role enrichment writes provider-managed bindings with `source` set to the provider type and `provider_id` set to the login provider id. `replace_external` login sync may only replace rows for the same `user_id + source + provider_id`.

### user_team_bindings

User-to-organization bindings. The table name remains `team` for compatibility, but the runtime semantics are organization membership. Local assignments keep `source = local`; OIDC, OAuth2, Feishu, DingTalk, and WeCom login mapping writes provider-managed rows with `source/provider_id` for external-only replacement.

### policies

ABAC policy definitions. JSONB fits:

- subject matcher
- target matcher
- conditions
- action list

### clusters

Cluster registry metadata and health snapshot.

JSONB fits:

- labels
- capabilities
- health_snapshot

### cluster_credentials_meta

Credential metadata only, not raw secret material in phase 1.

JSONB fits:

- provider metadata
- auth plugin settings

### announcements

Announcement catalog with publish lifecycle, audience metadata, and active-window fields.

### announcement_receipts

Per-user read receipts for published announcements.

### audit_logs

Append-only durable audit store.

JSONB fits:

- request_meta
- target_meta
- decision_meta

### operation_logs

Operational task records for mutating workflows.

Expected fields now include actor context, request context, and backend-owned `target_scope` JSON for UI formatting.

### AI Gateway credential and policy tables

AI-native external access is persisted under:

- `personal_access_tokens`
- `service_accounts`
- `service_account_tokens`
- `ai_clients`
- `ai_access_policies`
- `mcp_tool_grants`
- `ai_gateway_skill_bindings`
- `ai_gateway_audit_logs`

Token tables store only hashes and display prefixes. The clear token value is returned once at creation time and must not be logged or persisted outside a caller-owned credential store.

`mcp_tool_grants` supports `user`, `service_account`, `role`, `team`/organization, and `ai_client` subjects. Runtime evaluation combines matching subject, organization, role, and client grants, then applies deny-first and allow-list semantics on top of `permissionKeys`.

`ai_access_policies` and `ai_gateway_skill_bindings` use the same subject model. Access policies narrow tools and skills by tool pattern, skill id, risk level, and effect; skill bindings narrow available Skills and capability refs. Neither table can expand RBAC or scope grants.

### event_stream

Unified event envelope persistence.

JSONB fits:

- resource_ref
- payload
- correlation data

### build_records

Build history plus worker-emitted artifact metadata.

Expected metadata now includes:

- `applicationEnvironmentId`
- `buildSourceId`
- `artifact`
- `image`
- `variables`
- `triggeredByWorkflowRunId`

### deploy_records

Deploy and release history.

Expected metadata now includes:

- `applicationEnvironmentId`
- `actionKind`
- `previousImage`
- `image`
- `imageTag`

### application_build_sources

Per-application build-source registry.

### build_templates

Platform-managed Dockerfile and build-command templates.

### release_bundles

Immutable delivery version unit for promotion and audit.

### execution_tasks

Execution-plane task records for build, deploy, verification, and callback-driven provider work.

### execution_logs

Task-scoped execution logs persisted independently from build/release summary rows.

### execution_callbacks

Provider callback history used to advance execution-task state.

### virtualization_connections

KubeVirt and PVE connection records for the virtualization workbench. PVE secret material is stored only in `encrypted_credential`; API responses expose `credentialConfigured` instead of plaintext.

### virtualization_vms

Synchronized virtual machine assets keyed by provider, connection, and external ID.

### virtualization_images

Synchronized image and template assets discovered from KubeVirt CDI/PVC sources or PVE template, ISO, and storage content.

### virtualization_flavors

Standard VM sizing catalog managed by soha or discovered from providers.

### virtualization_tasks

Virtualization task queue for `vm_create`, `vm_action`, and `asset_sync`. This domain does not reuse delivery `execution_tasks`.

### virtualization_task_logs

Task-scoped logs for virtualization operations and sync runs.

### workflow_approvals

Approval decisions for suspended workflow runs, including optional metadata that links delivery workflow manual approvals back to AI Gateway approval requests.

### notification_channels

Reserved for email, webhook, chat, or incident channel settings.

## PostgreSQL Storage Boundary

Use PostgreSQL when:

- durability matters
- relational search matters
- retention matters
- auditability matters

Short-lived UI state, request-scoped cache, and live fanout should stay in process memory or explicit durable task/event tables until a concrete external dependency is reintroduced.
