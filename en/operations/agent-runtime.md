# Agent Runtime

## Positioning

The soha agent process now has two runtime responsibilities:

- Remote cluster agent: serves resource reads and limited operations for Kubernetes clusters registered with `connectionMode=agent`.
- Control-plane runner: claims delivery, Docker, and AI Agent Runtime work from the soha control plane and reports status through callbacks.

AI Agent Runtime is the shared execution abstraction used by the AI workbench, automation policies, and business diagnostics. Pages and business modules depend on soha capability contracts instead of depending directly on Hermes, OpenClaw, or any provider-specific agent.

Core abstractions:

- `AgentProvider`: a pluggable executor such as `internal` or `hermes`; future providers can include OpenClaw or other agents.
- `AgentCapability`: a platform capability such as `root_cause`, `performance`, `trace`, `inspection_review`, `delivery_failure`, or `docker_diagnosis`.
- `AgentToolBinding`: binds a capability to MCP adapters, platform read tools, or provider-native tools.
- `AgentSkillBinding`: maps soha skills to Hermes skills, prompt templates, or future provider skill systems.
- `AgentRun`: a durable agent execution with provider, capability, skills, toolset, scope, status, callback token, tool records, and output artifacts.

Hermes Agent is the first external provider. The soha agent runner claims `ai_agent_runs`, invokes the Hermes CLI or Hermes Agent capability, and writes results back as unified `AnalysisArtifact` records.

Each `AgentRun` stores a creation-time `toolBindings` and `skillBindings` snapshot. A runner claim receives the full soha capability contract: scope, toolset, budgets, platform playbooks, provider skill mappings, and MCP/internal tool mappings. Future OpenClaw, internal-agent, or other provider adapters should consume that snapshot instead of making pages or business modules derive Hermes/OpenClaw-specific parameters.

## Control-Plane Contract

The AI workbench safe catalog exposes Agent Runtime summaries:

- `GET /api/v1/copilot/workbench/catalog`
- `GET /api/v1/copilot/agent-providers`
- `GET /api/v1/copilot/agent-runs`

These authenticated user APIs return provider, capability, tool binding, skill binding, MCP adapter, data-source, analysis-profile, and skill-registry summaries. Full provider secrets and data-source credentials remain owned by Settings > AI.

Runner-facing APIs are protected by `runtime.execution_runner_token`:

- `POST /api/v1/copilot/agent-runs/claim`
- `POST /api/v1/copilot/agent-runs/callback`
- `POST /api/v1/copilot/agent-runs/tool-call`

`tool-call` is the controlled gateway for external providers to invoke soha tools. Requests must include both the runner bearer token and the current `AgentRun.callbackToken`, and may only call read-only tools captured in that run's `toolBindings` snapshot. The control plane currently executes log, metric, trace, platform-event, delivery-release, delivery-build, execution-task, platform-resource snapshot, Docker operation/service, virtualization operation, alert, and OnCall route-resolution queries, then records each call as `ToolExecution` for the final `AnalysisArtifact`. Provider adapters should not bypass this gateway to reach soha data sources or credentials directly.

The current Hermes/CLI provider POC in the runner prefetches up to 3 prefetchable read-only tool results before invoking the provider command, such as `events.query`, `logs.query`, `metrics.query`, `traces.query`, `delivery.releases.list`, `delivery.builds.list`, `delivery.execution_tasks.list`, `platform.resources.snapshot`, `docker.operations.list`, `docker.services.list`, `virtualization.operations.list`, `alerts.list`, and `oncall.routes.resolve`, then injects those results as `prefetchedToolResults` into the provider prompt and final output. This lets a provider consume soha-controlled tool context before it supports a private tool-call protocol. If Hermes or another agent is later connected as an MCP client, the runner adapter should wrap the same `tool-call` gateway as the provider-visible MCP/tool server and still avoid exposing soha data-source credentials.

The `AgentRun.toolBindings` snapshot is filtered at creation time by the creator or system principal's runtime permission keys. The runner token and callback token can only execute that already-filtered snapshot; they cannot expand access to data sources, tools, or business context the user could not access. Toolset adapter selection supports exact adapter ids such as `logs.v1` and source-kind aliases such as `logs`, `metrics`, or `traces`, but matching rules must remain explicit and test-covered.

These tools remain read-only and constrained by the `AgentRun.toolBindings` snapshot. Future providers or tools should still be wired through a reader/adapter in `executeAgentToolBindingOutput` before being added to the runner prefetch allowlist; high-risk write actions must not become direct chat tools.

`ai_agent_runs` is the durable queue table for AI Agent Runtime. Status values are:

- `queued`
- `running`
- `completed`
- `failed`
- `canceled`
- `callback_timeout`

## Analysis Flow

AI workbench explicit analysis flow:

1. The user selects provider, analysis profile, toolset, and analysis mode in an `/ai-workbench` session.
2. The frontend calls `POST /api/v1/copilot/sessions/:sessionID/analyze`.
3. The `internal` provider continues to run the soha in-process analysis path.
4. External providers enqueue an `AgentRun` and write an assistant message in queued state.
5. The agent runner claims the run.
6. The Hermes provider runner translates scope, toolset, skills, budget, and prompt into a Hermes invocation.
7. If the provider needs logs, metrics, traces, events, delivery release/build records, or alerts, the runner adapter should call soha tools through `agent-runs/tool-call`.
8. The runner posts `running`, `completed`, or `failed` callbacks.
9. The control plane converts provider output into soha `AnalysisArtifact`, preserving evidence, hypotheses, recommendations, graph, tool calls, and data-source snapshots.

Automation policy flow:

1. soha automation policy remains the primary scheduler for continuous analysis.
2. After an `alert_webhook` event arrives, automation policy matching handles labels, dedup windows, and cooldowns.
3. `agentProviderId=internal` uses the built-in analysis path.
4. `agentProviderId=hermes` or another external provider creates an asynchronous `AgentRun`.
5. Hermes cron is only an optional experimental provider-native capability, not the soha platform scheduler.

## Hermes Runner Config

The server must expose a runner token:

```yaml
runtime:
  execution_runner_token: demo-execution-runner-token
```

The agent enables AI Agent Runtime through `configs/agent.config.yaml`:

```yaml
control_plane:
  enabled: true
  base_url: http://127.0.0.1:8080
  bearer_token: demo-execution-runner-token
  agent_id: local-agent
  poll_interval: 5s
  agent_runtime:
    enabled: true
    worker_id: local-hermes-runner
    provider_ids:
      - hermes
    provider_kinds:
      - hermes
    hermes_command: hermes
    providers:
      hermes:
        command: hermes
        args:
          - chat
          - -Q
        prompt_arg: -q
        skill_arg: ""
        provider_skill_arg: -s
    workspace_root: ./.soha/agent-runtime
    poll_interval: 5s
```

Start the agent:

```bash
cd ../soha-agent
go run ./cmd/agent
```

Use a custom config file:

```bash
SOHA_AGENT_CONFIG_FILE=/abs/path/to/agent.config.yaml go run ./cmd/agent
```

Current Hermes provider POC rules:

- The runner only claims `AgentRun` rows whose provider id or kind matches `hermes`.
- The default command is `hermes`; override it with `control_plane.agent_runtime.hermes_command`.
- The runner converts soha run input plus tool-binding and skill-binding snapshots into a prompt, and prefers `AgentSkillBinding.providerSkillRef` as the Hermes CLI skill argument. It only falls back to soha skill ids when no provider skill ref exists.
- The runner exposes an `agent-runs/tool-call` client helper that provider adapters can use to execute authorized read-only tools from the run snapshot; the default Hermes CLI POC prefetches a small read-only tool context into the prompt, including logs, metrics, traces, events, delivery release/build, and alert context, but does not assume a private Hermes tool-call protocol.
- While the provider command is running, the runner periodically sends `running` heartbeat callbacks so the control plane keeps `lastHeartbeatAt` fresh. If a callback response returns a terminal status such as `canceled`, `callback_timeout`, `failed`, or `completed`, the runner cancels the local provider process and does not submit a final completed callback.
- `soha-agent/internal/agent/runner` has smoke coverage that does not require a real Hermes installation: a fake control plane verifies the full claim -> running callback -> tool-call prefetch -> CLI provider -> completed callback -> `AnalysisArtifact` protocol chain. Real environments should still point `hermes_command` at the Hermes CLI for final end-to-end validation.
- Callback `analysisArtifacts` are preferred as final artifacts. If none are returned, the runner and control plane synthesize a basic `AnalysisArtifact` from provider output while preserving provider evidence, hypotheses, recommendations, graph, toolExecutions, dataSourceSnapshot, and the runner's own tool execution record.

The runner now dispatches by provider executor. Hermes is the built-in default executor; other CLI-style providers can be connected through `control_plane.agent_runtime.providers.<providerKind>` first, for example:

```yaml
control_plane:
  agent_runtime:
    provider_ids:
      - openclaw
    provider_kinds:
      - openclaw
    providers:
      openclaw:
        command: openclaw
        args:
          - run
        prompt_arg: --prompt
        skill_arg: ""
        provider_skill_arg: --skill
```

This provider executor still receives only the soha `AgentRun` contract: the prompt includes scope, toolset, toolBindings, skillBindings, and the output schema; provider-native skill arguments come from `AgentSkillBinding.providerSkillRef`. If no executor is configured for a provider, the runner reports the run as failed instead of pretending the unknown provider can run through Hermes.

## Adding Providers

Adding a provider should extend only the adapter/runtime layer, not the AI workbench or business analysis flows:

1. Register an `AgentProvider` in the copilot service provider catalog.
2. Declare the provider-supported `AgentCapability` values.
3. Add `AgentToolBinding` and `AgentSkillBinding` entries for the capabilities.
4. Implement the provider-specific runner executor that translates `AgentRun` input into provider calls.
5. Keep callback output as soha `AnalysisArtifact` or a structure that can be synthesized into one.

Hard boundaries:

- Pages, handlers, and business modules must not call Hermes directly.
- soha owns budget, permissions, menus, audit, data redaction, and operation boundaries.
- Agents are pluggable executors only; they must not bypass soha MCP adapters, scope, toolset, tool-call gateway, or analysis profile contracts.
- High-risk write operations must not be auto-attached to chat flows. They must go through the owning business module's durable operation or approval flow.

## Remote Cluster Agent Scope

The same `soha-agent` binary still keeps the remote cluster agent APIs:

- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /api/v1/healthz`
- `GET /api/v1/platform/summary`
- `GET /api/v1/platform/namespaces`
- `GET /api/v1/platform/workloads/pods?namespace=default`
- `GET /api/v1/platform/workloads/deployments?namespace=default`
- `POST /api/v1/platform/actions/deployments/restart`
- `POST /api/v1/platform/actions/deployments/scale`

The remote cluster agent remains intentionally narrow. Logs, YAML, events, exec, and rollout history still need to be expanded under platform-agent semantics and must not be conflated with the AI Agent Runtime provider execution path.
